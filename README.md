This is a little silly game I developed for the Godot Community Game Jam - Dec 2016 / Jan 2017.

The main goal of this project was to test, debug, optimize and promote my platform2d plugin for the Godot Engine.
I also wanted to write code for boring stuff (title screen, level selection..) I will reuse in other projects.
